# 4bit-Image-Converter

This is a little script made in python for convert images to 16 colors bit map pictures 
with a similar structure that [usenti](https://www.coranac.com/projects/usenti/) uses.

Suported formats are ".bmp", ".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg"

For use it:
* First you need to open a terminal
* Change the path to the same folder of "requirements.txt"
* Run the folowing comand on a terminal to install all needed
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* Then you only need to put the "converter4Bit.py" in your proyect and use 
it like any other script.

Also you can use it from the terminal
```
python3 converter4Bit.py --dirs "img1.bmp" "im2.png" "imgsPath/" --output "outputdir"
```

To fix some errors use the --quantazie option

If you have some problem with the script please report it.
